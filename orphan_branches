                            Orphan Branches and How To Merge Them

Whenever you need an independent branch without any relation to any other available branches, you can create an orphan branch.
An orphan branch is a separate branch that starts with a different root commit.
So the first commit in this branch will be the root of this branch without having any history.
It can be accomplished by using the Git checkout command with the ––orphan option.

git checkout --orphan <branchname>

Once you have your commits in place on the orphan branch, it is time to merge them into your master branch. 
git checkout master
git merge fresh-start

As you can see, the orphan branch does not share history with the master branch, and git will not allow you to merge the branch.
However, you can still merge an orphan branch by allowing unrelated histories to be merged:

git merge fresh-start --allow-unrelated-histories

That's all!
